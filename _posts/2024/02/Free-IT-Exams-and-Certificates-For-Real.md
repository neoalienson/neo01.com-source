## Proctored vs Non-Proctored Examinations

There are many IT certifications available online, but some of these certificates can earn with non-proctored examinations, meaning that you can get the certificates simply by watching a few videos or taking a quiz with unlimited retries. However, some of the certificates listed on this page are proctored but still free. Proctored Examinations certificates are more widely recognized compared to non-proctored.

**Proctored examinations** are supervised assessments conducted under strict security measures to ensure exam integrity, featuring identity verification through government-issued ID or biometric authentication, live monitoring by human proctors or AI-powered surveillance systems, and controlled testing environments in physical test centers or secure online platforms. These exams restrict access to external resources, enforce time limits with anti-cheating measures, and typically allow single attempts or limited retries. In contrast, 

**non-proctored assessments** are self-paced online evaluations without supervision that require no identity verification, offer unlimited retries in most cases, often permit access to external resources, and allow completion at your own pace and location as part of online courses or training modules. Proctored certifications carry significantly more weight in the industry because they provide verifiable proof of knowledge and skills under controlled conditions, making them more trusted by employers and peers compared to their non-proctored counterparts.

**Rating on this page is subjective, based on the value of the certificate and its recognition according to my knowledge.**

!!!tip "💡 Pro Tip"
    Focus on proctored certifications first - they carry significantly more weight with employers and are worth the extra effort!
