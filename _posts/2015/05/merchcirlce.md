This is the application we built for the [MasterCode hackathon 2015 Hong Kong](/2015/04/mastercode-mastercard-hackathon-2015-hong-kong/). The application was submitted to http://www.hackathon.io/sellspree. The source code for this project can be found at 
[https://github.com/neoalienson/merchcircle-app](https://github.com/neoalienson/merchcircle-app) (iOS) and 
[https://github.com/neoalienson/merchcircle-web](https://github.com/neoalienson/merchcircle-web) (Web and Backend). The Web and backend hosts were on Heroku.

MerchCircle is the simplest solution for selling things to your friends. By tapping on 'Sell something', you can become a shop owner. You will be required to use MasterCard credit numbers, as we utilize the MasterCard money transfer API to receive money upon transaction completion.
