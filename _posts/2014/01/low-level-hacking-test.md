This is a simulation game that involves hacking an electronic lock. It requires a solid understanding of low-level programming. If you’re not familiar with Assembly, consider playing Watch Dogs instead. The game features a comprehensive in-game debugger and several debug symbols.

Hint: Read the hardware manual.

Below is the bit diagram of the Status Register (sr), which will be useful during hacking.
