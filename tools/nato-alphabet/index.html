        <h2>About NATO Alphabet Converter</h2>
        <p>NATO Alphabet Converter translates text into the NATO phonetic alphabet, a standardized system for clearly communicating letters over radio or phone. Each letter is represented by a distinct word (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.) to prevent confusion between similar-sounding letters. This tool instantly converts any text into its phonetic equivalent.</p>
        
        <p>The NATO phonetic alphabet was developed to ensure clear communication in noisy or low-quality audio environments. It's officially called the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet and is used worldwide by military, aviation, maritime, emergency services, and customer support. The converter handles letters, numbers, and common punctuation marks.</p>
        
        <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
        <p>Customer service representatives use the NATO alphabet when spelling names, confirmation codes, or serial numbers over the phone. Aviation professionals communicate call signs and coordinates. Military and emergency services ensure critical information is transmitted accurately. IT support spells passwords and license keys. Anyone needing to clearly communicate alphanumeric codes in voice conversations benefits from this system.</p>
        
        <p>Type or paste your text into the input field. The tool automatically converts each character to its NATO phonetic equivalent in real-time. All conversion happens locally in your browser.</p>
