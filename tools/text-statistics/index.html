        <h2>About Text Statistics</h2>
        <p>Text Statistics analyzes text to provide comprehensive metrics including character count, word count, sentence count, paragraph count, reading time, and more. These statistics are essential for writers meeting word limits, content creators optimizing for platforms, and anyone needing to understand text composition. The tool updates statistics in real-time as you type or paste content.</p>

It calculates estimated reading time based on average reading speed, average word length, and longest word. The tool handles multiple languages and provides accurate counts even with complex punctuation and formatting.</p>
